# flask-boilerplate
This boilerplate is a robust starting point for creating production-ready Flask applications. Although tailored for Flask, its core principles are versatile enough for other frameworks and languages. These include maintaining clean architecture, implementing domain-driven design (DDD), and adhering to the SOLID principles for object-oriented design. The project also incorporates the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Data Transfer Object (DTO) patterns, which enhance data management and system clarity. Embracing test-driven development (TDD), the boilerplate ensures high-quality, reliable code. By applying these best practices, developers can create scalable, maintainable applications that align with modern software engineering standards.
